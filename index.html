	<p>Though public libraries have shared internal data, such as circulation data, publicly via open data portals, bookmobile data sharing has been limited. Sponsored by the Washington State Library, and using data from North Central Regional Library as a pilot case, the Open Data Wagon project researched, collected, and then published library bookmobile data openly on data.wa.gov, along with a standard, reusable template. Because bookmobile operations can be expensive, this project sought to encourage information sharing among libraries, expand funding opportunities for mobile services programs by supplying additional data, and heighten library mobile services program visibility.
