		<h1>Project Research</h1>
		<h3>Landscape Survey</h3>
		<p>To better understand the bookmobile and open data landscape, we conducted a <a href="https://github.com/opendatawagon/research/blob/master/access-for-all-litreview.md">literature review</a>, surveying bookmobile history, current bookmobile ecosystem, public library open data, open data publishing, and data privacy â€” in addition to an initial proposition of data fields, based on our research. After the lit review, we spoke with mobile services and data experts, gathering their insight and feedback on our project and asking them about the most useful and sustainable bookmobile data we could collect.</p>
			
		<h3>Data Privacy</h3>
		<p>In the final stages of the project, we've also been interviewing subject experts about maintaining user privacy in open datasets, to ensure our final published dataset minimizes the risk of deidentification.
